# SolSec
SolSec is a platform built in Grizzlython that promotes web3 security on the solana ecosystem. Protocols can organise audit contests on the platform where rust developers from across the world can review their code base and submit bug reports.
<br><br>
Using SoSlSec, any project can create a contest where they submit their codebase along with a prize pool. Since the project can choose the amount of money to be distrbuted, it allows smaller projects to participate and get their code audited. Auditing is a crucial step for any protocol that is serious about launching on mainnet and handle customer funds.
<br><br>
SolSec is meant to be governed by a DAO. It is desiged in such a way that will eventually lead to the members of the community taking decisions on day to day opertions and sharing the profits generated by providing it's services.
